# Web developer

Hello, I'm Matheus, glad to see you here. 👋
After a long time, I'm on my way to realize my dream and I'll work with development. I'm working hard. 

## 🚀 My stack

- Programming languages
    - JavaScript
    - TypeScript
- Frontend
    - HTML5
    - CSS3
    - Bootstrap
    - Sass
    - React
- Backend
    - NodeJS
    - TypeORM
    - REST API
    - JWT
- Database
    - SQL Server
    - PostgreSQL
    - MySQL

## What I'm learning now 👨🏻‍💻
I'm working to remember everything about **authentication, authorization, NoSQL/SQL databases** and after some basic projects, I'll make my real portfolio.

## Why I didn't commit for a long time?
I've spent a long time doing nothing and giving up everything, being more and more weak in my confort zone. Now I come back, getting stronger day by day, working on my time to get a good job and give my family everything they deserve.
